First things first, let's import `pandas`. 

```python
import pandas as pd
```

This gives us access to all the useful code in the `pandas` library. That's about 1500 files and 400,000 lines of Python, plus some high-performance bits written in Cython and C - so we just saved ourselves a lot of work. 

## Data types in `pandas`

On top of all the usual Python object types (like `str`, `int` and `float`), `pandas` has two main types of its own: `Series` and `DataFrame`. These are both containers for labelled data.

A `Series` is a 1-dimensional container, similar to a list, with some extra functionality. A `DataFrame` is essentially a collection of `Series`. You can think of a `DataFrame` as a table (like in Microsoft Excel or a SQL database), with `Series` for columns. 

![A Series is a 1-D labelled array](../fig/01_table_series.svg) 

![A DataFrame is a 2-D labelled array](../fig/01_table_dataframe.svg)

> - A `DataFrame` contains 2-dimensional, labelled data - like a matrix, or a table
{: .callout}

Most of the time you'll be probably interacting with `DataFrame`s. However, many of same principles apply to both `Series` and `DataFrame`s, and the concepts are easier to understand when we're just looking at a single dimension, so we'll learn a bit about `Series` to start with. 

## Key concepts for a `Series`

We can create a `Series` from a `list`, a `range`, or a `dict`:

```{python}
integers = pd.Series([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
evens = pd.Series(range(0, 10, 2)) # range(start, stop, step) 
ordinals = pd.Series({1: 'first', 2: 'second', 3: 'third', 4: 'fourth'})

print(f"integers (from list):\n{integers}\n")
print(f"evens (from range):\n{evens}\n")
print(f"ordinals (from dict):\n{ordinals}\n")
```


There are a few things to notice here. We'll go through the important points.

### Access data by its label using `loc[]`

Each of the `Series` has a set of labels, shown on the left in the output above. This is the index. Data elements can be accessed via these labels, using the function `Series.loc`:

```python
print(integers.loc[2])
print(evens.loc[2])
print(ordinals.loc[2])
```

```output
2
4
second
```

> The `loc` function let's us access data using its label. It takes values in square brackets `[]`
{: .callout}

For `integers` and `evens`, we just passed in a sequence of values and `pandas` automatically created an index, using numbers starting from zero. To create `ordinals`, we passed in a `dict`, which already includes labels. `pandas` used these labels to create the index. Note that in our case, the labels are all integers, but they don't have to be - for example, they could be strings, or dates. 

> Indexes contain the labels for data. They are often sequences of integers, but they don't have to be.
{: .callout}

### Access data by its position using `iloc[]`

Sometimes we might want to access data in a specific _position_, rather than by using its index label. `pandas` provides another function for this, called `iloc`:

```python
print(integers.iloc[0])
print(evens.iloc[0])
print(ordinals.iloc[0])
```

```output
0
0
first
```

> The `iloc` function let's us access data using its position. Like `loc`, it takes values in square brackets `[]`
{: .callout}

> Note that `iloc` is "0-indexed" - the first element is number 0, the i-th element is number i-1.
{: .callout}

What if we want to get more than one value at a time? We can use `loc` and `iloc` for that too. 

### Get multiple values by passing a list to `loc[]`

If we give `loc` a list of labels, we'll get back just the values indexed by those labels:

```python
evens.loc[[1, 3]]
```

```output
1    2
3    6
dtype: int64
```

### Get a slice of data with a colon `:`

With `iloc` we can specify a range of values using a colon `:`. This is called a slice:

```python
ordinals.iloc[1:3]
```

```output
2    second
3     third
dtype: object
```

Note that the slice contains everything up to but **not including** the second index provided. 

> Slicing a `Series` using `iloc[start:stop]` returns a range of values at the positions `start` to `stop-1`. 
{: .callout}

If we omit a value on either side of the colon, the range will extend to the end of the `Series` - so `[:2]` is equivalent to `[0:2]`.

{: .challenge}

### Filter data on conditions using boolean indexing

You can select only the subset of data that meets specific criteria using a technique called boolean indexing. To get the integers that are greater than 2, we can use:

```python
integers.loc[integers > 2]
```

```output
3    3
4    4
dtype: int64
```

What's happening here? The `>` operator compares each element of `integers` to 2, and returns `True` or `False` for each one. This creates a `Series`:

```python
evens > 2
```

```output
0    False
1    False
2     True
3     True
4     True
dtype: bool
```

We're then passing this `Series` into `loc` and using it to tell pandas whether or not we want each value. 

There are lots of operators and functions that can be used to return boolean values. Some common ones are 

- `<`: "less than"
- `>`: "greater than"
- `==`: "equal to" (note the double equals symbol!)
- `<=`: "less than or equal to"
- `>=`: "greater than or equal to"
- `!=`: "not equal to"

You can combine criteria using logical operators with the symbols `|` for "or", `&` for "and", and `~` for "not". For example, we can get even numbers that are greater than 3 and less than 8 using:

```python
evens.loc[(evens > 3) & (evens < 8)]
```

```output
2    4
3    6
dtype: int64
```

We'll go into this in more depth later.

### A `Series` has a single data type

Each of the `Series` has a data type. When we print a `Series`, the data type (`dtype`) is shown beneath the contents. `integers` and `evens` both have the dtype `int64`. This is simple enough, they both contains integers. However, `ordinals`, whose data elements are strings, shows `dtype: object`. Why is this? 

The `object` type is like a generic catch-all. It was used before `pandas` was able to support strings, and it remains in situations like this because the developers didn't want to break things. There are some good reasons for telling `pandas` to treat our data as strings instead. We can specify the data type when we create the `Series`, like this:

```python
str_ordinals = pd.Series({1: 'first', 2: 'second', 3: 'third', 4: 'fourth'}, dtype="string")
print(str_ordinals)
```

```output
1     first
2    second
3     third
4    fourth
dtype: string
```

Or we can create a new `Series` from the old one, converting the type, like this:

```python
str_ordinals = ordinals.astype("string")
```

> `Series` are intended to store data of a single type. This means that in general, a `Series` should contain only, for example, text or numbers - not both. 
> 
> We can specify the data type of a `Series` when we create it.
{: .callout}

## `DataFrame`

A `DataFrame` has rows and columns. Like a `Series`, it has labels, but both the rows and the columns have labels. Let's combine our `Series` into a single `DataFrame`:

```python
numbers = pd.DataFrame({'integers': integers, 'evens': evens, 'ordinals': str_ordinals})
print(numbers)
```

```output
   integers  evens ordinals
0         0      0     <NA>
1         1      2    first
2         2      4   second
3         3      6    third
4         4      8   fourth
```

Each of our `Series` is now a column in `numbers`, and we used a dict to pass in column labels. Note that the data types are not printed. 

The `Series` are merged on their index. Because the `Series` have a lot of index labels in common, this works pretty well for us. However, `ordinals` has only 4 values instead of 5, and it only starts at 1 - there's no common way of spelling "0th" ("zeroth"? "zeroeth"? "zeroast"?). This means that when the indexes are merged, the `ordinals` column has a missing value.

> Missing values are represented as `<NA>`
{: .callout}

### Get rows from a `DataFrame` using `loc[row_label]`

Now when we use the `loc` function with a single value, we get back a whole row:

```python
print(numbers.loc[1])
```

```output
integers        1
evens           2
ordinals    first
Name: 1, dtype: object
```

The output here is a `Series` containing all the data from the row at index value 1. The index labels for this new `Series` correspond to the column labels from the `DataFrame`. The row has a `dtype`, which is object, because we have a mix of strings and numbers. 

If we pass a list of values, we'll get back a `DataFrame` containing multiple rows:

```python
numbers.loc[[1, 3]]
```

```output
   integers  evens ordinals
1         1      2    first
3         3      6    third
```

If we take a slice of a `DataFrame` (using a colon `:` like before), we'll get back another DataFrame:

```python
df.loc[1:3]
```

```output
   integers  evens ordinals
1         1      2    first
2         2      4   second
3         3      6    third
```

In these examples we're specifying the row, and `pandas` assumes that we want every column. What if we don't?

### Specify columns in a `DataFrame` using `loc[row_label, column_label]`

If we want to access a single element in the `DataFrame`, we need to pass two labels to `loc`: one for the row, and one for the column. In our example `DataFrame` the rows are indexed with numbers, but the columns are indexed with strings, so we need to use, for example:

```python
numbers.loc[2, 'evens']
```

> The index order in a `DataFrame` is `[row, column]`
{: .callout}

What if we want to access a whole column? If you solved the challenge above, you'll remember that a slice with no endpoints returns the whole `Series`. We can use this like so:

```python
numbers.loc[:, 'integers']
```

```output
0    0
1    1
2    2
3    3
4    4
Name: integers, dtype: int64
```
